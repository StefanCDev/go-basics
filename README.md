This repository contains a series of coding exercises and challenges that progressively develop skills in Go programming and shell scripting. The tasks range from beginner-level fundamentals, such as printing digits and letters, to more advanced challenges, including custom algorithm implementations like the IsSorted function.

The exercises are designed to foster problem-solving skills and follow the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD). For reference and additional challenges, the original tasks can be found in the 01-edu public repository.

Whether you're new to Go or looking to strengthen your understanding of its concepts, this repository serves as a great learning resource.
